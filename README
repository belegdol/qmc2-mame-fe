M.A.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II - v0.241
---------------------------------------

What is the M.A.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II?
-------------------------------------------

M.A.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II - also referred to as QMC2 - is the successor of
one of the first UNIX M.A.M.E. GUI front ends available on this planet called
QMamecat (derived from MAMECAT, which was text-only). QMamecat was based upon
Qt 2; its development was frozen in 2003.

By the beginning of March 2006, we started to build QMC2 from scratch as a Qt 4
project. Parts of the design and code were inspired by its predecessor, but it's
not just a remake. We tried to make the new design as flexible as possible to
minimize dependencies from front end and CLI related MAME changes, which was a
major deficiency of QMamecat. QMC2 now uses a template based emulator config
scheme, which can easily be enhanced with additional command line options
(defined in an XML template file).

As a result of this flexible design and countless hours of work, QMC2 today is
not only a stable, feature-rich and fast multi-platform GUI front-end for
M.A.M.E. but also a fully-featured ROM manager for this emulator (and its
derivatives, older versions of MAME or even foreign emulators when they use the
same/similar XML syntax) through the built-in ROMAlyzer.

Today, only Qt 5+ is supported. Note that for the full functionality of QMC2
Qt 5.11 or above is required!
