NAME
  qmc2-sdlmame - QMC2 - M.A.M.E. Catalog/Launcher II

SYNOPSIS
  qmc2-sdlmame [-config_path path] [-cc] [-tc] [-r] [-h|-?|-help] [qt_arguments]

DESCRIPTION
  QMC2 is a graphical front-end based on Qt which drives the great MAME emulator. Besides being a powerful catalog and launcher for systems emulated by MAME it also contains sophisticated ROM management
  features through its built-in ROMAlyzer.

OPTIONS
  -config_path path  Specify this argument to use the directory path instead of the default folder (CONFIG_PATH) to store QMC2's configuration, logs and cache-files / cache-folders.

  -cc  This command line option will instruct QMC2 to clear all emulator related caches while starting up in order to forcibly reload this data from the emulator.

  -tc  Specifying this option on the command line will perform a template check against the current default emulator (if set), printing its output to stdout and exiting before actual start-up occurs.

  -r  The reconfigure option will relaunch the setup wizard / welcome dialog before starting. This allows you to update or correct the most important emulator settings in an easy way.

  -h|-?|-help  Shows a brief command line usage help.

  qt_arguments  See https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qapplication.html#QApplication for more information. However, note that QMC2 will overwrite most of the available Qt arguments with its saved settings in CONFIG_PATH/qmc2.ini.
