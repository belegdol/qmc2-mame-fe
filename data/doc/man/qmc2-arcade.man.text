NAME
  qmc2-arcade - Arcade / non-desktop version of QMC2 - M.A.M.E. Catalog/Launcher II

SYNOPSIS
  qmc2-arcade [-theme qml_theme] [-console type] [-language lang] [-video vdo] [-config_path path] [-fullscreen] [-windowed] [-nojoy] [-joy index] [-debugjoy] [-debugkeys] [-debugqt] [-h|-?|-help]

DESCRIPTION
  For those who want to 'go straight into the games' there's QMC2 Arcade, a QML / QtQuick based approach to presenting an optionally filtered
  machine-list, launching emulators in the same smart way that you're used to with QMC2's main GUI (see qmc2(6)).

  Although it's designed to run stand-alone, you must start QMC2's main GUI at least once prior to using QMC2 Arcade, because some of
  the file caches need to be created first - QMC2 Arcade doesn't take care of this itself. Also, you cannot change the emulator's configuration
  from within QMC2 Arcade. So whenever you want to make modifications to a machine's configuration (or the global setup) you have to do this
  through QMC2's main GUI as well.

  The main GUI also has a specific dialog for setting up all relevant back-end default options (-theme, -console, -graphicssystem, -language
  and -video), for producing a filtered machine list used by QMC2 Arcade exclusively (optional) and for mapping key-sequences or
  joystick-functions (also optional). Default values for back-end options can also be configured inside QMC2 Arcade provided the chosen
  qml_theme supports it (which all of the available themes do).

  Changed back-end default options will require a restart of QMC2 Arcade to take effect. Specifying them on the command line will overwrite
  the current defaults temporarily, but will not change their stored default values. Note that the -language back-end default option is a shared
  setting for both QMC2 Arcade and the main GUI.

OPTIONS
  -theme qml_theme  Select the QML theme used for scene graphics, animations and/or shader effects. Available values for qml_theme are 'ToxicWaste'
                    (default) and 'darkone'.

  -console type  Choose the type of console to use. Available values for type are 'terminal' (default), 'window', 'window-minimized' and 'none'.
                 Console type 'none' will effectively suppress all log messages.

  -language lang  Choose translation to load. Run 'qmc2-arcade -h' for a list of available values for lang. Note that the default value for -language
                  is shared with the main GUI's language setting!

  -video vdo  Enable (vdo = 'on') or disable (vdo = 'off') the use of video snaps (theme-specific). The value of vdo will be ignored when the current
              theme has no built-in support for video snaps.

  -config_path path  Specify this argument to use the directory path instead of the default folder (CONFIG_PATH) to search for QMC2's configuration
                     and cache-files.

  -fullscreen  Start up in full screen mode, overwriting the stored setting

  -windowed  Start up in windowed mode, overwriting the stored setting

  -nojoy  Disable joystick-function mapping (regardless if it's enabled in the main GUI or not).

  -joy index  Use the joystick specified by index instead of the one read from CONFIG_PATH/qmc2.ini, and enable joystick-function mapping (regardless
              if it's enabled in the main GUI or not).

  -debugjoy  Enable debug logging for joystick-function mapping. Every recognized joystick-function which has been mapped to a key-sequence will be
             logged to the console.

  -debugkeys  Enable debug logging for key-sequence mapping. Every recognized key or key-sequence will be logged to the console together with info on
              how the event is processed. Mapped key-sequences will cause event emulation, others will follow Qt's default event processing.

  -debugqt  Enable logging of Qt debug messages

  -h|-?|-help  Show usage help, available options / values and their current defaults.

FILES
  SYS_CONF_DIR/qmc2/qmc2.ini  System-wide default configuration (optional)

  CONFIG_PATH/qmc2.ini  Individual user's configuration

  CONFIG_PATH/mame.mlc  Machine list cache

  CONFIG_PATH/mame.mlc.filtered  Filtered version of the machine list cache created by qmc2(6) (optional)

  CONFIG_PATH/mame-icon-cache.db  Icon cache database (SQLite 3)

  CONFIG_PATH/mame-dat-info.db  DAT-info database (SQLite 3), a combined data store for all supported DAT-info sources (emu-info, machine-info and software-info)
