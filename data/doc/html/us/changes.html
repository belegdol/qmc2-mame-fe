<p><b>v0.243, 09-APR-2022:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: avoid crash when using the command line option -tc</li>
	<li>imp: updated bundled minizip-ng to 3.0.5 (thanks to Julian Sikorski)</li>
	<li>imp: updated bundled zlib to 1.2.12</li>
	<li>imp: updated bundled LZMA SDK to 21.07</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.243</li>
	<li>inf: QMC2 Arcade more or less doesn't work right now</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.242, 02-APR-2022:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>new: moved a lot of files around for better readability and changed the build process to use git instead of svn</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.218, 28-FEB-2020:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>imp: removed the sample checker and all related UI hooks since it may be misleading</li>
	<li>imp: pure Qt 5 support which also means <b>no embedded emulator</b> - at least for now</li>
	<li>imp: made support for 7zip a little more <i>modern</i> by replacing its boolean type with real <i>bool</i></li>
	<li>imp: added <i>Zarth's Visual Template</i> to the list of notes templates</li>
	<li>inf: resuming work on QMC2 after a longer break - caused by several strokes :(</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.195, 01-MAR-2018:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: sample- &amp; software-state checks: merge the process output channels (<i>stdio</i> and <i>stderr</i>) because <code>-verifysamples</code> and <code>-verifysoftlist</code> use both channels in the meantime</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the restoration of the last machine list view during initialization for non-WIP builds</li>
	<li>fix: manual scanner: corrected the font used for logging (general log-font)</li>
	<li>fix: adjusted machine list set counters due to changes in <code>-listfull</code> since MAME 0.195 - this means that <b>MAME 0.195+ is required now</b> (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=165" target="_blank">BT #165</a>)</li>
	<li>imp: improved performance when searching for machines</li>
	<li>imp: removed the slot-info cache and all related UI hooks as it's no longer required for the upcoming new device configurator</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.195 (added core state / playback options 'rewind' and 'rewind_capacity', added core artwork options 'fallback_artwork' and 'override_artwork', added core miscellaneous option 'nvram_save')</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.195</li>
	<li>new: emulator options: added an <i>enforce default</i> toggle switch to every option's action items so the user can decide to <b>explicitly</b> pass the default value to the emulator (which QMC2 would usually not do)</li>
	<li>wip: reimplementing the device configurator for modern MAME - <b>WIP-info: this doesn't work properly yet and it won't load, produce or save any useful slot- &amp; device-setups for you at the moment, the feature isn't WIP-ified though as it's already too geared with rest of the UI!</b></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.192, 29-NOV-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: corrected build issues when using Qt 5.9.x (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=157" target="_blank">BT #157</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: repeat the last search when the software-list is reloaded and a non-empty search pattern is present (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=158" target="_blank">BT #158</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: corrected statistics string to also include the number of search matches (<i>S:&lt;n&gt;</i>) when state-checking is disabled</li>
	<li>fix: welcome dialog: explicitly set the GUI font if it has been customized before</li>
	<li>fix: welcome dialog: fixed reverting to the current language setting when the dialog is reject()'ed (i.e. <i>Cancel</i> is clicked or <i>Escape</i> is pressed)</li>
	<li>fix: video player: avoid some of the possible race conditions related to switching machines quickly while the <i>attached videos</i> list is being created</li>
	<li>fix: video player: do not request video image data from YouTube again when the image is already cached, and don't request anything for local videos (oops)</li>
	<li>fix: avoid updating detail-tabs while the tab-widget itself is being recreated (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=160" target="_blank">BT #160</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: worked around a Qt bug to fix initial detail-tab header scrolling when the current tab is <i>far to the right</i> (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=161" target="_blank">BT #161</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: video player: avoid loading the video info map multiple times</li>
	<li>fix: video overlay widget: don't display status messages when the main GUI is minimized (as the overlay is actually a parentless window it's not receiving the "minimize event" implicitly)</li>
	<li>fix: avoid UI flicker when initially showing the loading animation with active category- or version-view</li>
	<li>fix: example system-notes template: when on Windows, provide a play/pause button alternative for controlling the HTML5 video canvas as the built-in controls don't work</li>
	<li>imp: ignore the new <i>dtd</i> emulator option when checking the template map</li>
	<li>imp: MinGW builds: changed the Makefile to support the newer MAME-dev tools, including Qt 5, but Qt 4 is still recommended (note that for Qt 5 <code>&lt;mingw-folder&gt;/usr/bin/sh.exe</code> <b>must be renamed or removed</b>, otherwise <code>qmake</code> won't produce correct paths - see <a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-48876" target="_blank">QTBUG-48876</a> which unfortunately isn't fixed but <i>closed</i>)</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.192</li>
	<li>imp: obsolete (or invalid) emulator options are now automatically removed when the options are stored</li>
	<li>imp: video player: greatly improved the way the widget is reloaded upon changing the current system</li>
	<li>imp: replaced the <i>ghost</i> video thumbnail with a more neutral image to avoid misinterpretation (also renamed the corresponding notes-template macro from <i>$GHOST_VIDEO$</i> to <i>$VIDEO_THUMBNAIL$</i>)</li>
	<li>imp: revised or replaced several icons</li>
	<li>imp: example system notes template: removed the "opacity fade in" feature from the <i>fancy</i> image style (CSS) as it takes a duration of 1s that may cause issues if systems are switched very quickly</li>
	<li>imp: added a key-event filter for the search boxes in order to disable their default handling of <code>Up</code> / <code>Down</code> key input (because this causes issues with the way QMC2 uses the drop-down list as a search history)</li>
	<li>new: finalized the advanced setup wizard (started in 0.186) and promoted it to non-WIP</li>
	<li>new: notes-templates: added a new JavaScript-accessible funtion to query the current operating system name (see <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Miscellaneous_functions" target="_blank">wiki</a>)</li>
	<li>wip: adding freely customizable <i>filtered machine list views</i> (consumers of the machine list database added in 0.66, aka <i>custom views</i>) that can optionally be attached to the UI</li>
	<li>doc: added a note about <i>escaping</i> special characters to both the software-search's tool-tip and the <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#Searching_for_machines" target="_blank">QMC2 guide</a> (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=153" target="_blank">BT #153</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.187, 02-JUL-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: software-lists: reverted a change from v0.183 which prevented multi-part software from being mounted correctly (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=145" target="_blank">BT #145</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: fixed that the system-notes widget gets hidden when a machine is launched while the "notes" tab is the current one (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=147" target="_blank">BT #147</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: corrected loading zipped custom artwork data for notes templates (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=149" target="_blank">BT #149</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: notes-editor: avoid a potential (temporary) hang caused by text-wrapping the generated JS/HTML code when switching to the HTML tab (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=150" target="_blank">BT #150</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: some theme-specific settings were not correctly restored</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: software images weren't correctly updated on the search results page</li>
	<li>imp: updated the alternative system- and software-notes templates contributed by <a href="credits.html#Shideravan">Jos&eacute; Marcio Rezende Franco</a></li>
	<li>imp: notes-editor: the notes-editor's tab-bar uses a smaller font size now (2/3 of the general application font's size)</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.187</li>
	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: delay image, video and info updates when the user flicks the machine list quickly</li>
	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade / ToxicWaste theme: the cabinet can now be scaled independently from its automatic positioning (mouse wheel) and the menu bar's fade-in/out is animated</li>
	<li>new: added optional support for dynamically filtering machines according to their potentially changing ROM states during full audits (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=144" target="_blank">BT #144</a>)</li>
	<li>new: QMC2 Arcade: added support for the icon cache database (used if enabled in the main GUI)</li>
	<li>new: QMC2 Arcade: added the new CLI option <code>-debugqt</code> which will enable logging of Qt debug messages (which are now suppressed by default)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.186, 14-JUN-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: manual scanner: convert relative paths to absolute ones (so that the file URLs are correctly interpreted when launching the PDF viewer)</li>
	<li>fix: collection rebuilder: the collection rebuilder's specific settings weren't stored under certain circumstances</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the initial restoration of the tab-header of the current machine-detail when the tab-header has to be scrolled</li>
	<li>fix: corrected UI behavior when the given emulator executable file's path does not exist during reload (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=143" target="_blank">BT #143</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: added a hard limit of 2 GB per analyzed dump (the analyzer will skip individual dumps which are bigger than QByteArray's limit, avoiding a crash)</li>
	<li>fix: avoid a crash when interrupting a ROM verification of tagged sets (the process is now cleanly interruptable)</li>
	<li>fix: the <i>enable log</i> settings of the check-sum scanner log and the collection rebuilder were not restored</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the ROM- and software-state checks to work with MAME 0.186+</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: removed the temporary workaround for launching ColecoVision&trade; cartridge images since the issue has been fixed in MAME 0.184</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.186</li>
	<li>imp: added a confirmation pop-up which tells the user that it's much faster to do a full ROM audit than to check ROM states individually above a certain amount of sets (shown for more than 500 tagged sets)</li>
	<li>imp: removed the <i>-qmc2_config_path</i> option which was renamed to <i>-config_path</i> in v0.42 (the old name was still supported as a more or less hidden alias)</li>
	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: renamed the former <i>Report</i> tab to <i>Analyzer</i> and moved the related widgets to it, so that they are no longer suggesting a global meaning</li>
	<li>new: collection rebuilder: added support for rebuilding dumps that are larger than 2 GB individually (e.g. 'hapyfsh2', see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=142" target="_blank">BT #142</a>)</li>
	<li>new: notes-templates: added access functions for PDF manuals (see <a href="http://wiki.batcom-it.net/index.php?title=The_%27ultimate%27_guide_to_QMC2#PDF_manuals" target="_blank">wiki</a>)</li>
	<li>wip: ROMAlyzer: adding a <i>ROM path cleaner</i> sub-feature (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=82" target="_blank">BT #82</a>)</li>
	<li>wip: adding an advanced setup wizard as an alternative to the classic welcome dialog</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.183, 22-FEB-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: corrected the start-up restoration of the currently selected machine when said machine is hidden in the main view (aka 'full detail view') due to ROM state filtering</li>
	<li>fix: template check: when a (presumably) boolean type option changes its semantic, make sure that the check at least sees the changed default (example: the 'sound' option in current MAME)</li>
	<li>fix: correctly honor the <i>ShowROMStatusIcons</i> setting in the main view when the machine list is loaded from cache</li>
	<li>fix: system-notes: got rid of some MAME/MESS/UME leftovers (OMG!) which prevented titles from being displayed in system-notes when they were (7-)zipped</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.183</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 30-JAN-2017), now pre-built with <code>gulp</code></li>
	<li>imp: changed the category- and version-views to do an ascending sort of the category or version column before running the actual sort on the current criteria upon creation</li>
	<li>imp: avoid UI flicker when initially creating the category- or version-views</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.183 (changed the 'sound' option to correspond with current MAME)</li>
	<li>imp: improved the main setup dialog's (former) <i>Machine-list</i> tab (now called <i>Machine- / Software-lists</i>) by reorganizing the different options in separate sections</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: get rid of using a temporary file for looking up mountable devices for the current slot setup, use the standard input channel instead (we actually got rid of using a temporary file <b>completely</b>, so the corresponding setting has been removed as well)</li>
	<li>imp: device configurator: adopted MAME's new formatting of the <code>-listslots</code> output (this means that <b>MAME 0.183 is required now!</b>)</li>
	<li>imp: component setup: when a feature isn't allowed to be removed (i.e. the per-machine emulator configuration), indicate this by disabling the <i>deactivate</i> button</li>
	<li>imp: the context-menu of each component's tab-widget is now accessible by right-clicking the header (instead of a small area above it)</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: use <code>list:name</code> instead of <code>list:name:part</code> when generating software-specific arguments</li>
	<li>imp: software-lists: added a (temporary) workaround for launching ColecoVision&trade; cartridge images (see <a href="http://mametesters.org/view.php?id=6504" target="_blank">MT bug #6504</a>)</li>
	<li>imp: device configurator: a loading animation is shown when the slot info cache has to be recreated (the previous indication for this was too subtle)</li>
	<li>new: the last ten machine search patterns that were added to the drop-down list (i.e. by pressing <i>Return</i> or <i>Enter</i>) are saved and restored now</li>
	<li>new: added a <i>relaunch setup wizard</i> item to the tools menu which will stop and restart QMC2 with the <code>-r</code> command line option</li>
	<li>new: software-lists: added support for saving and restoring the last selected software item per system (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=140" target="_blank">BT #140</a>)</li>
	<li>new: added support for system- and software-manuals (in PDF format), allowing the use of an external PDF viewer (system default) as an alternative to the internal one which doesn't work everywhere (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=141" target="_blank">BT #141</a>, <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=116" target="_blank">BT #116</a>)</li>
	<li>new: each component's current tab can also be switched through the tab-widget header's context-menu now (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=134" target="_blank">BT #134</a>)</li>
	<li>inf: changed the versioning scheme to match MAME's version from now on (due to popular demand) - this should avoid confusion in the future</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.71, 26-JAN-2017:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: software-lists: corrected the initial update of custom software artwork when the images are loaded from a zip- or 7z-archive (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=137" target="_blank">BT #137</a>)</li>
	<li>fix: software-lists: avoid a possible crash when recreating the software-list XML cache DB</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.182</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 12-JAN-2017)</li>
	<li>imp: updated the emulator configuration templates to MAME 0.182 (added HTTP server and PortAudio options)</li>
	<li>imp: updated the bundled version of zlib to 1.2.11 (see <a href="http://zlib.net/ChangeLog.txt" target="_blank">zlib's change-log</a> for details)</li>
 	<li>imp: updated the bundled version of the LZMA SDK to 16.04 (see <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/sdk.html" target="_blank">LZMA SDK's homepage</a> for details)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.70, 30-NOV-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer / collection rebuilder: corrected the logged uncompressed size of a dump when reading from a ZIP archive through minizip (minor)</li>
	<li>fix: image or icon sources weren't refreshed correctly when the decompressor setup (zip, 7z or libarchive) was changed on-the-fly</li>
	<li>fix: honor the component setup / tab order when updating the tab icon for the currently selected view</li>
	<li>imp: removed all 'terminate emulator' actions as they don't work with modern MAME ('kill emulator' actions still work and got a nicer icon)</li>
 	<li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.9 which adds an optional 'wip' attribute for emulator options</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 27-OCT-2016)</li>
	<li>imp: updated the os-detection script to also support Arch Linux (also added a distribution specific configuration file for it)</li>
	<li>imp: slightly improved start-up performance</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.180</li>
	<li>imp: renamed all remaining settings that were still using the string "Game" in their names to a "Machine" pendant</li>
	<li>imp: emulator configuration templates updated to MAME 0.180 (added new core option 'homepath')</li>
	<li>imp: updated minizip to a newer git revision (as of 14-NOV-2016)</li>
	<li>new: added a new 'icon cache database' which stores decompressed icon data already <i>mapped</i> to machine IDs (this should speed up icon loading for everyone but can be disabled if not)</li>
	<li>new: reimplemented the support for MAME output notifiers in a platform independent way (this requires a <i>modern</i> version of MAME)</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: added optional automatic adjustment of the emulator's <i>-statename</i> parameter for easier state-file separation -- see also <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=129" target="_blank">BT #129</a></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.69, 27-OCT-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: when identifying dumps contained in zip- or 7z-archives, fall back to a member's file name if its CRC exists multiple times within the archive</li>

	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: the check-sum wizard has been renamed to 'check-sum finder' and its auto-repair feature has been removed (it's no longer required, the collection rebuilder is much better at this)</li>
	<li>imp: emulator configuration templates updated to MAME 0.179 (added new core search path option 'swpath')</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.68, 28-SEP-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>imp: updated minizip to a newer git revision (as of 28-AUG-2016)</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 31-AUG-2016)</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.178</li>
	<li>imp: emulator configuration templates updated to MAME 0.178 (added new OSD video option 'monitorprovider')</li>
	<li>new: added two new options to the ROM status exporter which allow for exporting only favorites or tagged sets</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.67, 01-SEP-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: build: corrected the VC++ project generation script to use bundled zlib / minizip</li>

	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.177</li>
	<li>imp: emulator configuration templates updated to MAME 0.177 (added new core render options 'autostretchxy' and 'unevenstretchy')</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.66, 27-JUL-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: device configurator: don't implicitly save device configurations on item activation as it may kill the currently chosen configuration's mappings</li>
	<li>fix: fixed a rare start-up crash caused by not waiting for the options to be fully applied</li>
	<li>fix: corrected the man-page generation script (<code>scripts/txt2man.sh</code>) to not output an unsupported macro</li>
	<li>fix: Qt 5 build fixes (<a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=130" target="_blank">BT #130</a>)</li>

	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.176</li>
	<li>imp: build: system-wide zlib and/or minizip libraries can now be used by specifying SYSTEM_ZLIB=1 and/or SYSTEM_MINIZIP=1 -- thanks to Julian Sikorski</li>
	<li>imp: build: revised the Makefile to cleanlier support building &amp; installing of qchdman and qmc2-arcade</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 10-JUL-2016)</li>
	<li>new: added a machine list database that's used by additional filtered custom views (WIP-info: the view is already *mostly* working)</li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.65, 01-JUL-2016:</b></p>
<ul>
	<li>fix: don't prevent the 'automatic ROM check' from starting when the 'Check ROMs' action gets triggered while the machine list is being reloaded</li>
	<li>fix: image checker: added obsolete file removal support when using libarchive (missing unintentionally)</li>
	<li>fix: image checker: corrected checking for obsolete icon files when read from a directory (this verified only PNGs as valid but the restriction is long gone)</li>
	<li>imp: video player: accept youtu.be besides youtube.com when copy-pasting video URLs</li>
	<li>imp: updated category.ini to MAME 0.175</li>
	<li>imp: emulator configuration templates updated to MAME 0.175 (removed core option 'antialias', added Windows-specific option 'vector_beam_smooth')</li>
	<li>imp: changed the default command line for the 7zip removal tool to include <code>-mhc=off</code> (disables header compression which libarchive doesn't support) and <code>-ms=off</code> (disables solid blocks which are generally counter productive for our use case)</li>
	<li>imp: pre-caching icons from a directory will no longer block the GUI and works faster now (using QDirIterator)</li>
	<li>imp: updated PDF.js to a newer git revision (as of 11-JUN-2016)</li>
	<li>imp: hide the splash-screen as soon as the initial start-up is done (in case it's still open by that time - which is likely)</li>
	<li>imp: added a new alternative system-notes template contributed by <a href="credits.html#Shideravan">Jos&eacute; Marcio Rezende Franco</a> (data/gmn/Concise.html)</li>
	<li>new: ROMAlyzer / collection rebuilder: CHD files are now optionally included in the reproduction process (automatically renaming them if required); you can choose between creating hard links, symbolic links and real copies, or to omit CHD reproduction completely (which is the default) -- see also <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=114" target="_blank">BT #114</a></li>
	<li>new: added a catver.ini optimizer to potentially speed up loading slightly</li>
	<li>new: emulator identification is now skipped when the binary's modification time hasn't changed - this generally speeds up loading greatly (but can be disabled in case it causes any trouble)</li>
</ul>

 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: added an 'enable log output' option to both the check-sum scanner and the collection rebuilder (when disabled, log messages emitted by the respective worker thread are suppressed)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: added a 'deep scan' option to the check-sum scanner - when enabled (default), the scanner will uncompress each ZIP/7z member in order to recalculate its check-sums (SHA-1, CRC and dump size), otherwise it will rely on the header check-sums (CRC and dump size)</li>
 	<li>imp: notes templates: added 3 new notes editor functions to retrieve system-, emu- and software-info within scripts</li>

 	<li>imp: replaced the colored sphere icons showing the ROM status with new images</li>
 	<li>imp: using QHash instead of QMap for all internal item lookup tables (less dependent on the number of entries, thus faster in the long run)</li>
 	<li>imp: drastically improved the performance of all game/machine and software-list views by enabling <i>uniformRowHeights</i> which allows for neat optimizations by Qt (improves loading time as well as sorting and scrolling)</li>
 	<li>imp: check-sum scanner: lowered the algorithmic complexity of steps 1 and 3 when preparing incremental scans, so this works remarkably faster now</li>
 	<li>imp: slightly darkened the text-color for ROM-/software-state 'mostly correct' for better readability</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a second 'copy to clipboard' function that only copies the bad or missing dumps from a given set and excludes columns that aren't important for this purpose</li>

 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: corrected set rewriter issues with data read from regular files (their CRCs couldn't be correlated)</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: the default ZIP compression level (Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION) is -1, corresponding to level 6, but the spin-box only supported values from 0 to 9 so the default level was actually 0</li>
 	<li>fix: avoid crash when checking an individual set's ROM status (probably only seen on slow systems)</li>

 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS/UME emulator templates updated to 0.155 (added new templates for SDL2 builds)</li>
 	<li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.8 which adds support for ignoring &lt;choice&gt; nodes on certain platforms (or generally)</li>
 	<li>imp: improved mouse event handling of rank-item widgets (also fixes a minor UI bug)</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a check-sum database for storing/retrieving paths to dumps available in your file-system by SHA-1 and/or CRC (aka support for <i>unstructured additional ROM paths</i>) -- see also <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=62" target="_blank">BT #62</a></li>

 	<li>imp: consecutive duplicate words in SDL joystick names are now cleaned up -- i.e. "Logitech Logitech Extreme 3D" becomes "Logitech Extreme 3D"</li>
 	<li>imp: QMC2 Arcade: added support for theme-specific default values used by certain settings -- i.e. <i>darkone</i> uses a 'sortByName' setting with an expected default value of 'true', <i>ToxicWaste</i> doesn't (want to) support this setting and uses the global default value of 'false' instead</li>

 	<li>imp: don't be fussy about <i>ignored</i> options when checking emulator configuration templates (they are ignored for good reason, so why confuse users by mentioning them?)</li>

 	<li>new: automatically clear all emulator caches when the output of '-listfull' changes (optional, enabled by default) -- something users often forget is using QMC2's -cc command line switch when updating their MAME/MESS/UME SVN builds; this feature is supposed to automate that as far as possible (changes to devices and software-lists aren't recognized automatically)</li>
 	<li>new: added command line option '-tc' which will check the emulator configuration template (printing results to <i>stdout</i>) and exit before actual start-up occurs</li>

 	<li>imp: demo-mode: added an option to launch emulators sequentially rather than randomly</li>
 	<li>imp: Win32 MinGW build: changed the default for 'MKSPEC' to 'win32-g++-4.6' -- <b>this assumes Qt 4.8</b>, so whoever still uses Qt 4.7 has to pass 'MKSPEC=win32-g++' on the make command (i.e. 'make configure MKSPEC=win32-g++')</li>

 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: the set rewriter and checksum wizard now also load repro-data from regular files (when they are stored in expected folders and have the correct file names / CRCs), the set rewriter can also reproduce sets in individual sub-directories (see 'reproduction type' in ROMAlyzer settings)</li>

 	<li>new: added <a href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/PDF.js" target="_blank">PDF.js</a> -- a JavaScript / HTML5 PDF rendering library</li>
 	<li>new: added support for HTML5 'localStorage' to the MiniWebBrowser and notes-templates (this allows templates to store and retrieve local settings)</li>
 	<li>new: system- and software-notes templates: exposing the notes-editor object to JavaScript allowing templates to call editor slots directly (!) -- right now, there are four slots you can use: 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.loadCurrentTemplate()' will reload the template itself (for example to react on changed settings), 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getIconData()' will return the base64-encoded icon data which you can use in &lt;img&gt; tags, 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getColor()' will open a color-dialog and returns a named color, and finally 'qmc2NotesEditorObject.getImage()' will open a file-dialog to select an image file (see data/gmn/template.html for an example)</li>
 	<li>new: MESS device configurator: allow in-place renaming of stored device configurations (see context menu)</li>

 	<li>new: file-chooser: folders can now be included in the file-list and are opened/followed when double-clicked or Enter/Return is pressed on them (there's also a new context-menu item for this); the <i>folder-mode</i> itself can be switched through a new menu-button in the widget's tool-bar (folders are hidden by default, select 'Show folders' to display them or 'Show folders first' to show them on top of the file-list, before any regular files)</li>
 	<li>new: added a new QML based implementation of the long-awaited 'arcade mode' as a stand-alone application (<i>QMC2 Arcade</i>, see arcade/ folder)</li>
 	<li>new: added support for Qt 5.0, however, the <b>recommended Qt version remains 4.8</b> (when Qt 5 is used, the build rules will automatically disable embedder functionality on X11 platforms as well as all Phonon features on all platforms -- this is due to dropped Qt modules, add-on modules may cover this later perhaps)</li>

 	<li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.6 which adds support to ignore complete sections (globally or per target OS)</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: don't compile <i>runonce</i> as it's not used on Mac OS X (and has an X11 requirement)</li>
 	<li>imp: integrated zlib updated to version 1.2.7 (see <a href="http://zlib.net/ChangeLog.txt" target="_blank">zlib's change-log</a> for details)</li>
 	<li>imp: Win32 MinGW build: added OS auto-detection for Windows so specification of MINGW=1 is no longer required (however, if MINGW is set, its value will be used regardless)</li>
 	<li>imp: when a non-default (= foreign) emulator is selected for the current game/machine, the device-mapper and software-list tabs are disabled now</li>
 	<li>imp: sets with <i>empty</i> names are now ignored, logging corresponding warnings when the game/machine list cache is recreated (this is a driver bug which also '-validate' will warn about)</li>
 	<li>imp: Win32 VC++ build: added x64 support to the project generation script</li>
 	<li>imp: added an advanced line-edit containing an icon to symbolize its function (used in certain search widgets)</li>
 	<li>imp: changed the default short-cuts for adding games/machines to the favorites list (now Ctrl+J and Ctrl+Shift+J) to free the Ctrl+F short-cut for another/better use (i.e. for finding arbitrary text)</li>
 	<li>imp: changed the default short-cut for 'About QMC2' (now Ctrl+B) to free the Ctrl+A short-cut which is commonly used for 'select all'</li>
 	<li>imp: file-chooser: opened ZIP contents are sorted as well</li>
 	<li>imp: completely revised the image cache internals, now also storing the file path the cached image was loaded from, which can be retrieved via the image's context-menu (the file path is not available in case of zipped images, though)</li>
 	<li>imp: much better GUI response while recreating the XML cache and checking all ROMs (full audit)</li>
 	<li>imp: animate searching for game/machine XML data when the user expands an item in the primary (full-detail) view</li>
 	<li>imp: the menu-bar on Mac OS X is no longer 'native' because this misbehaves with <i>multiple</i> menu-bars that we have now</li>
 	<li>imp: emulator configuration widgets are now initially hidden and shown after all options were loaded, which speeds up this process a little bit (you won't see a <i>visual</i> difference, though)</li>
 	<li>imp: added OS detection for Windows 8 and Mac OS X 10.8 to the about dialog when Qt 4.8.3 or higher is used</li>
 	<li>new: added support for <a href="http://mamedev.emulab.it/haze/" target="_blank">David Haywood's (Haze)</a> <i>Universal Machine Emulator</i> (MAME/MESS unification project) in the form of an additional variant called 'qmc2-ume' or 'qmc2-sdlume' -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=22" target="_blank">BT #22</a></li>

 	<li>new: added support for the new MESS category.ini from <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=5387" target="_blank">ASH</a> (UME targets merge the info with data from catver.ini, if applicable)</li>
 	<li>new: added a check for the ROM path setting (a warning message will pop up when the ROM path hasn't been set or isn't available) -- see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=28" target="_blank">BT #28</a></li>
 	<li>new: made a complete rewrite of the image-checker dialog, which now allows checks of ALL image types in a multi-threaded way -- this also fixes a long-standing bug on Windows, BTW (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=5" target="_blank">BT #5</a>)</li>
 	<li>new: MESS device configurator: added support for <i>nested</i> slots, including real slot recursion</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: available mount-devices are dynamically updated whenever the device/slot setup changes</li>
 	<li>new: added 3 new actions to tag / untag / invert tags of all <i>visible</i> sets (according to the current ROM state filter)</li>
 	<li>new: game/machine detail tabs can now also be reordered directly in the GUI by dragging them with the mouse</li>
 	<li>new: added a tool action to open a new empty browser window on demand</li>
 	<li>new: &lt;info&gt; elements contained in a number of software-list entries are now displayed as well (requires very recent MAME/MESS/UME versions after 0.146u5, otherwise &lt;info&gt; elements are not contained in the -listsoftware output)</li>
 	<li>new: items in all game/machine list views can now be tagged/untagged while the 'cursor' is moved, using the new (customizable) short-cuts Shift+Up and Shift+Down (works much like in 'Total Commander' when tagging/untagging files or folders)</li>
 	<li>new: the file-chooser now offers an additional context-menu item to open regular files (<b>not</b> ZIP content yet!) externally by launching the default application that's associated with the file's MIME type (or extension)</li>
 	<li>new: added a 'personal rich-text notes' detail for games/machines (same as the software-notes feature, but for systems this time)</li>
 	<li>new: added command line option '-cc' which clears (removes) all emulator caches prior to starting up</li>
 	<li>new: HTML editor: added document preview in built-in browser as well as 'new-from-template' and 'revert-from-saved-file' functionality</li>
 	<li>new: MESS device configurator: added support for selecting the BIOS used in slot-devices (if applicable)</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: optional automatic adjustment of the emulator's <i>-snapname</i> parameter for easier creation of software-snapshots</li>
 	<li>doc: use a common image directory instead of sym-links</li>
 	<li>inf: the configuration template for MAMEUIFX32 has been dropped (unmaintained)</li>
 	<li>inf: long project name changed to <i>M.A.M.E./M.E.S.S./U.M.E. Catalog / Launcher II</i></li>
</ul>
<p><b>v0.36, 21-MAY-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't stop searching for CHDs at the first ROM path (when there are multiple ROM paths)</li>
 	<li>fix: allow embedding of (MAME/MESS-like) foreign emulators again -- changes made in 0.35 prevented this completely</li>
 	<li>fix: changed the default short-cut for the <i>check template map</i> action to 'Ctrl+Shift+C' -- the previous default of 'Ctrl+C' was awkward since it's usually used as short-cut for <i>copy to clipboard</i></li>
 	<li>fix: avoid crashes in the game list parser and the ROMAlyzer's checksum wizard due to unexpected nameless entries (first appeared in MESS 0.145u1+)</li>
 	<li>fix: build: corrected a new set of compile-time bugs related to builds with PHONON=0</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: after updating CHDs to the latest format, update the CHD header information from the replaced file before comparing the SHA1 checksums</li>
 	<li>fix: minor: corrected a few texts with regard to the current variant's emulator type (MAME vs. MESS)</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: expand/collapse ZIP-contents on any type of 'activation' (i.e. not only on mouse double-clicks but also when enter or return are pressed, includes navigation via cursor-keys)</li>
 	<li>fix: re-enable 'locked' widgets when the emulator can't be started for reading the game/machine data</li>
 	<li>fix: MESS device configurator: corrected display of file-editor's data when there's only one available device instance (by synchronizing delegate/model updates)</li>
 	<li>fix: don't start a verification process when the ROM state cache can't be opened for writing</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: the machine-dependent software-folder was not correctly pre-selected when existing device configurations were loaded in parallel</li>
 	<li>fix: MESS device configurator: avoid a rare crash when systems are hovered very quickly (asynchronous updates may otherwise work on meanwhile invalid data)</li>
 	<li>fix: clear favorites and play-history upon reload and make sure the last selected game/machine is correctly re-selected (if applicable)</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: when repairing a set and the wanted CRC or name (header-)entry already exists in the target ZIP, recreate the complete ZIP file in order to replace the 'bad' file</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: don't rewrite sets that are analyzed on behalf of the checksum-wizard (even if 'rewrite while analyzing' has been activated)</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected some additional MESS-specific phrases and removed WIP-only stuff from key- &amp; joystick-mappers</li>

 	<li>fix: MiniWebBrowser: don't raise main-widget / lower browser window(s) when selecting the path to save a downloadable resource</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected character conversion when compressing HTML data stored in in-memory and on-disk web-caches (using QString::toLocal8Bit() instead of QString::toLatin1() now)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: LRU-caching XML data positions in order to speed up merge-processing</li>
 	<li>imp: updated the MAME variant's logo with an improved version from JacKc</li>
 	<li>imp: MESS device configurator: log a warning when '-listslots' crashes</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.146 (fixed duplication of option 'natural' in MESS templates)</li>
 	<li>imp: interpret the new 'has no roms' status as 'good' (a.k.a. correct)</li>
 	<li>imp: foreign emulator support: added $DESCRIPTION$ as an optional argument placeholder for the set's description</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: interpret emu- and file-states of sets that have no ROMs as 'good' also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROM status check: circumvent the corner case of sets without ROMs also in case of MAME (new since 0.145u2, see 'ide_baseboard' and 'hdd' devices)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: log possible driver XML bugs where a merge-name is given without a parent set to take it from (other than this, these cases are ignored and treated as 'good' merge-states)</li>
 	<li>imp: when registering foreign emulators, the existence of the <i>$ID$</i> placeholder on the supplied command line is now indicated through a green/yellow colored label (when $ID$ is missing, the configuration will most likely not work)</li>
 	<li>imp: allow the specification of the emulator's working directory already in the welcome dialog</li>
 	<li>imp: updated redistributed Qt translations from Qt 4.8.1</li>
 	<li>imp: honor 'players' value for device sets where applicable (i.e. some input devices)</li>

 	<li>imp: main widget: revised all auto-connected menu actions to use QAction::triggered(bool) (instead of a meanwhile deprecated signal)</li>
 	<li>imp: slightly better responsiveness while loading cached XML data</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: avoid using xcodebuild for Qt 4.8+</li>
 	<li>imp: replaced the 'MESS wiki driver look-up' with a ProjectMESS-based search since most data in the MESS wiki was lost, and ProjectMESS is the new de-facto '#1 web-resource for all things MESS' :)</li>
 	<li>imp: the MiniWebBrowser's zoom-factor can now also be specified through a (mouse) wheel-event when the Ctrl-key is pressed at the same time (like most standalone browsers)</li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added support for CHD v5 (new since MAME/MESS 0.145u1) -- built-in analysis will work for CHD v3, v4 and v5; however, note that all 'CHD manager' functionality <b>requires chdman from MAME/MESS 0.145u1+ now</b></li>
 	<li>new: ROMAlyzer: added a function to store the current log contents to a file</li>
 	<li>new: added tear-off capability to all menus within menu-bars</li>
 	<li>new: added freely customizable lists of game/machine IDs (and descriptions) that can be attached to foreign emulators and be presented / launched through the menu</li>
 	<li>new: both the MAWS (off-line) and the ProjectMESS driver look-up features save/restore their zoom-factors now</li>
 	<li>new: experimental support for Qt 5, which is in alpha-stage right now (there will be no embedder support on X11 platforms in the first place, since they dropped some X11-specific classes like the QX11EmbedContainer -- an add-on for Qt 5 to revive this functionality is planned, but will probably not be available before Qt 5.1)</li>
 	<li>new: YouTube video-player: you can now also 'paste' a YouTube video URL into the video-player itself, which will then start playing the respective video without attaching it to the play list</li>
 	<li>new: about dialog: added output of run-time Qt library paths to the system-information page</li>
 	<li>new: integrated zlib 1.2.6 to remove the extra requirement</li>
 	<li>new: the MiniWebBrowser now supports and allows pop-up window requests when the build option BROWSER_JAVASCRIPT is enabled (which is the default)</li>
 	<li>new: build option BROWSER_EXTRAS is now enabled by default which also activates the use of QtWebKit's <i>Web Inspector</i> in the MiniWebBrowser for everyone</li>
 	<li>new: added a Spanish translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Daniel">Daniel Barrado</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding a set rename tool to the ROMAlyzer which uses the -listxml outputs from both the old and the current emulator to gather the changes automagically</li>
 	<li>wip: adding a Romanian translation (mostly done) -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Mihai">Mihai Boisteanu</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding an Italian translation -- thanks to <a href="credits.html#Stefano">Stefano Cereda</a></li>
 	<li>wip: adding a stand-alone CHDMAN GUI (see tools/qchdman/)</li>

<p><b>v0.35, 06-FEB-2012:</b></p>
<ul>
 	<li>fix: minor: hide the software-list favorites column 'device configuration' for MAME targets as it's a MESS-only feature</li>
 	<li>fix: minor: corrected the main progress-bar's visual behavior when ROM status checking and software-list caching are running in parallel</li>
 	<li>fix: MAME targets: the software-list widget wasn't cleared upon reload</li>
 	<li>fix: the last active detail-tab's header wasn't always shown initially</li>
 	<li>fix: software-snapshots were positioned incorrectly under certain circumstances</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected a few minor log-scrolling issues</li>
 	<li>fix: individual ROM checks didn't work correctly when the ROM status was 'not found' since output is written to stderr in this case and not to stdout as otherwise</li>
 	<li>fix: YouTube video-player: avoid crashes on exit by waiting for all application threads to finish before returning to the OS</li>
 	<li>fix: YouTube video-player: attached videos could get lost when changing the current game/machine very quickly</li>
 	<li>fix: ROMAlyzer: correctly 'remove' the progress-bar item-widget before deleting it (worked w/o until Qt 4.7.x, crashed since Qt 4.8.0)</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected restoration of main-widget's layout when the front-end was showing a maximized embedded emulator during clean up on the previous run</li>
 	<li>fix: corrected Windows 64-bit builds with DEBUG=2 (see <a href="http://tracker.batcom-it.net/view.php?id=21" target="_blank">BT #21</a>)</li>
 	<li>fix: file-chooser: the underlying item model now produces correct minimum widths for icon-less columns (size and modification date)</li>
 	<li>fix: embedder on X11: corrected initial input focus after launching a new embedded emulator</li>
 	<li>imp: ROM status exporter: additional output-format choice ('all formats') to export the ROM states to all three formats at once</li>
 	<li>imp: when a software-list can't be found (though it's expected to exist), leave the software-list widget disabled and don't try to parse the invalid XML (a warning will still be logged since this is actually an emulator bug, but probably also a wanted/known situation as told by <a href="http://forums.bannister.org/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showprofile&User=1564" target="_blank">etabeta78</a>)</li>
 	<li>imp: MAME/MESS emulator templates updated to 0.145</li>
 	<li>imp: faster display of software-snapshots by using tool-tip like window attributes for the viewer widget (this also fixes bad-window errors on X11)</li>
 	<li>imp: slightly bigger icons in all game/machine list views</li>
 	<li>imp: updated template format to v0.2.5 which adds support for an optional 'part' attribute that can be used in file-type options to specify the extracted part of the file's path (currently only "basename" is supported, used by the effect-option)</li>
 	<li>imp: loading of software-lists can be interrupted now and is indicated accordingly for larger lists (i.e. cpc_cass/cpc_flop)</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: moved macx/Info.plist.in to arch/Darwin/Info.plist.in where it belongs</li>
 	<li>imp: build: added a 'configure' make target to create platform dependent project file(s) and stop (i.e. to open it in XCode and build from there on Mac OS X, or to run MinGW make in job-server mode on Windows)</li>
 	<li>imp: MiniWebBrowser: browser-plugins are now enabled by default (see make option <i>BROWSER_PLUGINS</i>)</li>
 	<li>imp: build: removed make option <i>PRETTY</i> as it's no longer usable in the supported Qt versions</li>
 	<li>imp: Mac OS X build: provide application icons (.icns) to be associated with the apps</li>
 	<li>imp: created new logo images (thanks to JacKc)</li>
 	<li>imp: ROMAlyzer: checksum-wizard: when the user changes the checksum-type and the current checksum is available in the 'other' type as well, display it in the line-edit (not available when the checksum is edited manually)</li>
 	<li>new: the ROM state filtering mechanism can now be enabled/disabled on-the-fly (the default is 'enabled', just as before)</li>
 	<li>new: added support for multi-device software-list entries as well as automatic vs. manual mount-device selection (includes the ability to mix parts from different software-list entries)</li>
 	<li>new: added an alternative game/machine search entry box to the tool-bar</li>
 	<li>new: added a CSV and ASCII export tool for software-lists</li>
 	<li>new: added import/export functionality for software-list <i>favorites</i></li>
 	<li>new: changed the MESS device configurator so it offers available device-instances based on the slot-options specified, thus allowing to <i>mount</i> them as well (through the legacy device-mapper and the file-chooser)</li>
 	<li>new: added ZIP support for software-snapshots</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: game/machine icons are now also shown on the tab headers of embedded emulators</li>
 	<li>new: all images have an additional context-menu item ('refresh') now to clear and reload their cached pendants</li>
 	<li>new: integrated the HTML editor from <a href="http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-labs/graphics-dojo" target="_blank">Qt Labs / graphics-dojo</a> for all kinds of (upcoming) rich-text editing purposes</li>
 	<li>new: added content-zoom to the MiniWebBrowser</li>
 	<li>new: top-level windows can now optionally be minimized upon emulation launch and automatically restored when the (last) emulator instance has ended</li>
 	<li>new: YouTube video-player: added a semi-transparent overlay widget to display status information at the bottom of the player's viewport</li>
 	<li>new: software-lists: added software-compatibility filtering</li>
 	<li>new: added a 'MESS wiki' detail to look up available driver information</li>
 	<li>new: added an option to suppress all messages sent through QDebug and related convenience functions</li>
 	<li>new: added an optional startup splash-screen utilizing the new logos</li>
 	<li>new: added support for emulator-embedding on Windows (!) -- note, however, that embedding of emulators running in <i>Direct 3D</i> mode ('-video d3d') has two known issues: full-screen switching will lead to a crash (of the emulator) and screen-shots aren't taken correctly from within the GUI (just a black image)</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: added an option to select the <i>default launch-mode</i> used when starting emulation by <i>activating</i> (i.e. double-clicking) an entry in any list</li>
 	<li>new: X11 and Windows only: replaced the style-controlled embedder-release icons (usually a red 'X' which some users wrongly interpreted as 'exit emulator') with a more suitable / less irritating and style-independent icon by setting explicit style-sheets on the tab-bars of all embedders</li>
 	<li>new: added two options to allow for hiding of BIOS and/or device sets in all master-lists (see <i>Front end</i> -&gt; <i>Game/Machine list</i> in the main setup dialog) -- both will trigger an automatic reload when changed</li>
 	<li>new: added a dock-able/floating software-detail widget with a separate snapshot-browser, a <a href="http://www.progettoemma.net/mess/" target="_blank">ProjectMESS</a> software-lookup feature, and an HTML editor/viewer for personal rich-text software-notes</li>
 	<li>inf: <b>the new required minimum Qt version is 4.7.0</b>, support for older versions of Qt has been dropped</li>

 	<li>imp: X11 only: minor embedder optimizations regarding widget resizing</li>
 	<li>imp: YouTube video player: added support for YouTube's new way of presenting video stream URLs</li>

 	<li>new: added a 'driver status' column to all game/machine lists (or views)</li>
 	<li>new: Windows only: the <i>other</i> variant's exe file can now be specified explicitly (the default is to search for it only in the directory where the calling variant was started from) -- this works also when you rename the exe files; you can additionally specify the command line arguments passed to the <i>other</i> variant (note that this is an independent setting and would also be used when the variant exe is not overwritten!)</li>
 	<li>new: support for MAME's/MESS's new device-referencing (new since 0.143u2+ SVN)</li>
 	<li>new: Mac OS X only: the tool-bar can now optionally be unified with the title-bar</li>

 	<li>new: for ZIP-archived icons (actually the only practical way to store them) support for ICO format has been added -- this means that for instance <a href="http://icons.mameworld.info/" target="_blank">MAMU's icon</a> can now be used directly, w/o conversion to PNGs!</li>
 	<li>new: icons are now also supported for all MESS targets</li>
