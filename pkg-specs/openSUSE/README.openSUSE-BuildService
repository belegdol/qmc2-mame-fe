Usage notes for the openSUSE build service
------------------------------------------

- Run 'make dist' in the top-level directory first and upload the resulting
  archive ('../qmc2-<version>.tar.bz2') as 'qmc2-<version>.tar.bz2'

- Upload 'openSUSE-BuildService.spec' (from this folder) as 'qmc2.spec' (or
  take the symbolic link named 'qmc2.spec')

- The build process will start automatically
